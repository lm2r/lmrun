# DO NOT download or upload large files into a bucket mount folder:
# - cloning into a bucket incurs high latency + could crash FUSE (virtual FS)
# - download to disk is +3x faster & sequential upload gets 2x bandwidth
# - SkyPilot doesn't guarantee preservation of bucket file permissions, e.g.
#     when throttled, multipart mounted uploads can fail with 'Permission denied'
#
# 1. clone on disk
# 2. reset clone in case the repo was updated after reading the hash
# 3. delete .git, mostly for duplicate weights in .git/lfs/objects
# 4. rclone to bucket
