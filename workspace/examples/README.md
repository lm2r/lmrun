# Examples

These examples expect
1. a live K3s server to connect to the LMRun mesh: main nodes and their launch command are available in `/service`
2. configured providers: more info below

## Provider setup
AWS, Cloudfare R2, Lambda and Paperspace are already covered with more depth in `/workspace` and `the-mesh` subfolder.

For Fluidstack or others, refer to SkyPilot [doc](https://docs.skypilot.co/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html#fluidstack) to set up your API key locally like usual.
